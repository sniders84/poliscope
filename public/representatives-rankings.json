Ocasio-Cortez's face and flying at one, armed with swords, with President Biden's face. On Nov. 17, Rep. Gosar was [censured](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/117/hres789/text) and removed from his committee assignments (one of which he shared with Rep. Ocasio-Cortez) by a vote of [223-207](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/117-2021/h379).",

      "The House Committee on Ethics opened a new investigation on Mills after the House voted [310-303](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h302) to refer a [resolution of censure](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hres893/text) to the House Ethics Committee over a range of allegations, some of which were already being investigated. New allegations include a dispute over Mills's claims of holding a Bronze Star for his military service. In January 2026, the Committee established an [Investigative Subcommittee with members Garbarino, Subramanyam, Yakym and Pressley](https://ethics.house.gov/press-releases/statement-of-the-chairman-and-ranking-member-of-the-committee-on-ethics-regarding-representative-cory-mills-3/).",
      "On Feb. 19, 2024, Rep. Mills assaulted a woman in his home. The Metropolitan D.C. Police were called to the scene. The police have issued several reports on the incident, in increasingly less detail each time. The first report indicated that the victim said she was assaulted by Mills and she let police listen to a conversation with him in which he encouraged her to lie to the police. Subsequent reports have much less detail. An internal investigation of the handling of the matter is underway. An arrest warrant sent to the U. S. Attorney has not yet been signed. In October 2025, [a judge issued a restraining order against Mills](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/14/cory-mills-restraining-order-florida-00608307) to protect a different ex-girlfriend who broke up with him when the news of the above alleged assault became public. A [resolution to censure Mills](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hres893/text) for this and other conduct was referred to the House Committee on Ethics in November 2025.",
      "Rep. Mills was accused of ommitting or misrepresenting contributions to his campaign in financial disclosure documents, benefiting from federal contracts while in office and failing to properly disclose that as well, according to an August 2024 [Office of Congressional Ethics report](https://ethics.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/OCC-Report-and-Findings.pdf) which was made public in 2025. A [resolution to censure Mills](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hres893/text) for this and other conduct was referred to the House Committee on Ethics in November 2025."

      "In 2024, Rep. Ogles was accused of falsifying campaign finance reports when his amended finance reports were compared to the originals. He claimed he had loaned his campaign $320,000 in 2022 and had not. It's unclear whether the the money came from elsewhere or was entirely made up. He also amended finance reports to remove both contributions and expenditures. In the first week of August, 2024, a Department of Justice search was conducted and his cell phone seized. The House Ethics Committee began an investigation in 2024 and extended the matter into the 119th Congress."

He had been waiting on three members of Congress to finish their inspection of the facility. When they came back out and ICE began to try to arrest him, the Congress members tried to block ICE from doing so. They did not succeed, but the charges were dropped a few hours later.
